## About The Project 
The diabetes dataset is a well-known medical dataset used extensively in machine learning and data analysis to predict the likelihood of diabetes in female patients. It comprises 768 records, each representing an individual patient, and includes 8 diagnostic attributes along with a binary outcome variable. These attributes are: number of pregnancies, plasma glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skin fold thickness, serum insulin level, body mass index (BMI), diabetes pedigree function (which reflects genetic influence), and age. The outcome variable indicates whether the patient tested positive for diabetes (1) or not (0). This dataset is particularly valuable for classification tasks and is often used to train predictive models in healthcare. However, it contains some zero values in columns like insulin and skin thickness, which may represent missing data and require preprocessing. Overall, the dataset serves as a practical foundation for exploring medical diagnostics, feature engineering, and model evaluation in the context of chronic disease prediction.
## Visualise 
The histograms illustrate how the DiabetesPedigreeFunction—a measure of genetic predisposition to diabetes—is distributed among individuals with and without diabetes. For those diagnosed with diabetes (Outcome = 1), the values tend to be more spread out, with a noticeable concentration between 0.3 and 0.6, and a few cases extending beyond 2.0. This suggests that while many diabetic individuals have moderate hereditary risk, some exhibit very high genetic influence. In contrast, the distribution for non-diabetic individuals (Outcome = 0) is more tightly clustered in the lower range, particularly between 0.1 and 0.3, indicating that low pedigree scores are more common among those without diabetes. Very few non-diabetic individuals have high DiabetesPedigreeFunction values. Overall, the comparison reveals that higher pedigree scores are more frequently associated with diabetes, making this feature potentially valuable for predictive modeling, though it should be considered alongside other clinical variables for accurate diagnosis.
## Model 
In this analysis of the diabetes dataset, we approached the problem like a data scientist would—methodically and with curiosity. The goal was to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical features such as glucose level, BMI, age, and family history. We began by exploring the dataset, which contains 768 records and 8 diagnostic features, along with a binary target variable indicating diabetes presence. Visualizations like histograms helped us understand how features such as DiabetesPedigreeFunction vary between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, revealing that higher pedigree scores are more common among those with diabetes. Next, we prepared the data by splitting it into training and test sets and trained a logistic regression model. The model achieved 75% accuracy, with decent precision and recall, though it missed some diabetic cases, as seen in the confusion matrix. We also experimented with linear regression to predict probabilities, though it's not ideal for classification tasks. This hands-on process reflects how human analysts think—by questioning patterns, validating models, and interpreting results to improve predictions. Ultimately, this dataset offers a rich opportunity to practice classification, evaluate model performance, and understand the role of medical features in disease prediction.
